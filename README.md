# OBJECT DETECTION USING PYTHON<br>
Object Detection is a critical task in computer vision that combines classification and localization to identify what objects are present in an image and where they are located. This project showcases how to build and run object detection systems using Python, OpenCV, and popular pre-trained deep learning models such as YOLO (You Only Look Once) and MobileNet-SSD.<br>
The goal of this project is to provide a simple, modular, and easy-to-understand implementation of object detection that can be used for learning, experimentation, and real-world applications.<br>
üîç What This Project Can Do<br>
Perform object detection on static images<br>
Analyze and detect objects in video files<br>
Run real-time object detection using your system‚Äôs webcam<br>
Draw bounding boxes around detected objects and label them with class names and confidence scores<br>
Customize models, confidence thresholds, and label sets<br>
Support various pre-trained models including YOLOv3, YOLOv4, MobileNet-SSD, and others<br>
